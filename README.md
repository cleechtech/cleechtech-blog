Made with Hexo.js and [tranquilpeak-hexo-theme](https://github.com/LouisBarranqueiro/tranquilpeak-hexo-theme)

```
$ hexo new post "title goes here"
$ hexo generate
$ hexo server
```

To wipe tags:
```
$ hexo clean
```
New tags will be created when a build happens

Your build will automagically be deployed to the master branch of https://github.com/cleechtech/cleechtech.github.io (specified in **_config.yml**)
